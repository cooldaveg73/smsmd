The site is right now hosted at slicehost.com at ip 173.203.28.98
When you ssh into a server, you are on a live server on slicehost.
The application is routing requests that ping that server.

The server right now is configured to use apache. 
Even though it is simpler, do not use the built-in rails server.
(i.e. run rails server -d -e production -p 80 on the server).
This can cause a lot of issues with the server database and is incredibly
slow --> as in it can timeout easily.
I suggest apache, which uses the passenger mod to access the rails framework.
Apache will take you a little bit to figure out, but use the tutorials on 
slicehost's site. 
Capistrano is the rails standard for apps like MH and there is a pretty good
tutorial for that in the Agile Web Development with Rails book.

The DNS for the site (what points app.mobilizinghealth.org to 173.203.28.98) is
configured through nameservers at justhost.com.
In order to get justhost to change these settings, you must email them.
They will not allow you to set ip addresses for subdomains or your domains.
TODO: MH can save money by using a different dns manager and hosting the
www.mobilizinghealth.org on the slicehost server. However, this would require
a bit of configuration on the server. The price for justhost is $10 a month,
whereas the price for a regular DNS (i.e. simply point a domain to the ip)
is $10 a year. You can manage subdomains as aliases and edit the hosts on 
the server to point to the webapp or to whatever static files.

If you want to do advanced server caching for performance, Apache is not
really configured for this kind of use IN RAILS. I recommend using Mongrel or
Nginx or Capistrano rather than trying to use Apache with Passenger if
you want to do anything advanced. Setting up with Apache is pretty simple
and the industry standard.
