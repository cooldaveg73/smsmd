A guide for dealing with SMS Gup Shup

MH sets a response url for a dedicated keyword group longcode. However, the
only settings you can edit are for specified keyword groups.

A longcode is just the 10 digit system number.  It is dedictated because every
text that comes into the system should go to one url. Enterprise SMS Gup Shup
is configured for users to set up their framework on their site.  A keyword
group just means that certain letters tag to a certain URL. (Basically
everything that our app does REQ FIN ACC, etc).

There is no point in making a keyword group because we want it to be dedicated.
And their enterprise suite does not allow users to make dedicated longcodes.

THING TO REMEMBER: in order to edit settings for the dedicated keyword group,
you have to email SMS Gup Shup. You have to tell them something like: we want
every text to <system number> to go to <this url> i.e.
app.mobilizinghealth.org/healthbeta/sms/.

Our contacts right now are: 
Chris Dâ€™mello <chris@webaroo.com> 
Ketan Patel <ketan@webaroo.com> 
Nilesh Trivedi <nilesh@webaroo.com>

The only other setting to edit (which we can actually edit) on the enterprise
site is how it sets the delivery status of the message. On the current app,
this info is stored in the messages controller under delivery status. On the
site, you set this under the settings when you log into
enterprise.smsgupshup.com.

Always email them if you have questions. They are responsive.
