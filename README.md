# Mobilizing Health Web Application
NOTE: This program was originally intended to run at app.mobilizinghealth.org.
Since then, the operation has been acquired by MEDgle, Inc. as of 2012. MEDgle
decided to close the operation in February 2013.

## Goals
- enable sms communication between doctors and patients
- configure a web app that allows one person to manage the operation
- allow anyone to spin up a new operation with limited intervention from an admin
- low cost for the developer/non-profit and no cost for the operating body (payment incentives are organized outside of the app)
